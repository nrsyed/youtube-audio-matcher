# <span id="description">Description</span>

YouTube Audio Matcher enables you to download the audio from all videos on
any number of YouTube channels, perform audio fingerprinting on audio files,
and compare the audio fingerprints to an SQL database of audio fingerprints
to help identify the audio (similar to Shazam) or, optionally, add them to the
database. Local files and directories can also be provided as input.


# <span id="requirements">Requirements</span>
* Python &ge; 3.6
* [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org) or
  [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) browser, and
  [ChromeDriver](http://chromedriver.chromium.org/home)
* [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
* PostgreSQL or MySQL client/driver (see list of
  [SQLAlchemy–supported drivers/backends](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/engines.html))


# <span id="installation">Installation</span>

First, install the Python package.

```
git clone https://github.com/nrsyed/youtube-audio-matcher.git
cd youtube-audio-matcher
pip install .
```

Next, install a PostgreSQL or MySQL client and development files. These must
be installed before the SQL driver is installed with `pip`, as the
`pip install` requires them to build the relevant Python packages. Example
instructions for installing PostgreSQL/psycopg2 and MySQL/mysqlclient on Ubuntu
are shown below.

**PostgreSQL and psycopg2**
```
sudo apt install libpq-dev
pip install psycopg2
```

**MySQL and mysqlclient**
```
sudo apt install libmysqlclient-dev mysql-client-core-8.0
pip install mysqlclient
```


# <span id="background">Design and Background</span>

The program leverages Python asynchronous functions and coroutines, combined
with multithreading and multiprocessing, to efficiently download and/or process
files, summarized in the flow diagram below.

<img src="docs/img/yam_diagram.png" />

Any number of YouTube channel/user URLs and local files/directories can be
provided as input. A webscraping coroutine (the "get video metadata from page
source" block in the diagram) gets (via
[Selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/)) and parses (via
[BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/))
the complete page source for each URL and extracts information on each video
on the channel/user Videos page, namely the YouTube ID, duration, title. The
videos are filtered based on criteria supplied by the user (e.g., exclude
videos longer and/or shorter than a certain duration), after which they're
added to a download queue. A download coroutine ("download videos as mp3")
kicks off each download in a thread pool, in which each video is downloaded
via youtube-dl and converted to MP3 by ffmpeg. As each download completes, it's
added to a fingerprint queue. Any local files provided as input are
added directly to the fingerprint queue, since they don't need to be
downloaded. A third coroutine ("fingerprint songs") consumes songs from the
fingerprint queue and sends them to a process pool, where they are
fingerprinted using all available CPUs (see the
[Audio fingerprinting](#audio-fingerprinting) sub-section below). After
fingerprinting, each video is added to a database queue.

If the user opted to add songs to the database, the fingerprinted files are
passed to a coroutine that uses the process pool to add songs and their
fingerprints to the database.

If the user instead opted to match the input songs against the fingerprints
already in the database, the songs are passed to a coroutine that uses the
process pool to query the database and determine if there's a match. All
matches are ultimately returned (and optionally written to a text file as
JSON).

By offloading I/O-heavy downloads to a thread pool and CPU-heavy fingerprinting
and matching to other CPUs, a large number of files can be processed quickly.

## Audio fingerprinting

Audio fingerprinting refers to the act of turning audio into a set of hashes.
The first step of this involves obtaining the
[spectrogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram) of the song/audio,
which is effectively a measure of the intensity of the sound frequencies of the
audio over the course of the song. The spectrogram of the song *Phenomenal* by
Benjai is shown below (the images in this section were generated by the
[`yamfp`](#yamfp-usage) tool).

<img src="docs/img/spec_full.png" />

Next, we find the peaks in the spectrogram, i.e., the points in the spectrogram
with the greatest amplitude. The spectrogram for the first 10 seconds of the
song is shown below, with the peaks represented by red dots.

<img src="docs/img/spec_10_peaks.png" />

The song's fingerprints are generated from peaks of pairs in a process known
as combinatorial hashing, where we iterate through the peaks and, for each
peak, form pairs with its neighbors. The number of neighbors we consider is
termed the *fanout* value. This is shown in the figures below, which are taken
from the paper by Avery Wang, the founder of Shazam (see
[Acknowledgments](#acknowledgments)).

<img src="docs/img/combinatorial_hashing.png" />

The figure defines a "target zone" that determines which neighbors to consider
for each peak. Each peak pair is used to generate a hash based on the frequency
and time difference between each point—this constitutes a fingerprint. If we
use a target zone of +1 s to +10 s (and no restriction on the frequency) with a
fanout value of 2, the first 10 seconds of the song generate the following
*hash constellation*:

<img src="docs/img/fingerprint_hash_pairs_10_fanout2.png" />

If we increase the fanout value to 6, it looks more like the following:

<img src="docs/img/fingerprint_hash_pairs_10_fanout6.png" />

Increasing the fanout value results in more hash pairs, increasing the
robustness of the fingerprints but also increasing storage requirements
and computation time to find matches, since there can be tens or hundreds
of thousands of hash pairs for an entire song.

More on the algorithm used to match audio fingerprints to fingerprints in the
database can be found in the paper and in the source code (see the function
`youtube_audio_matcher.audio.fingerprint.align_matches`).


# <span id="examples">Examples</span>

### Add songs/fingerprints to the database

This command (which makes use of the package's `yam` command-line tool)
adds to the database (`-A`) a local file (`file1.mp3`), all files from a local
directory (`sample_directory`), and the first 60 seconds (`--duration 60`) of
audio from all videos on a YouTube channel (`www.youtube.com/c/sample_channel`),
excluding any videos shorter than 5 seconds (`-S 5`) or longer than 300 seconds
(`-L 300`), using the (PostgreSQL) database credentials `-U yam` (user `yam`),
`-N yam` (database name `yam`), and database password `yam` (`-P yam`).

**Command**:
```
yam -A www.youtube.com/c/sample_channel file1.mp3 sample_directory \
  -S 5 -L 300 --duration 60 -U yam -N yam -P yam
```

**Output**:
```

```

### Match songs against the database

This command (which makes use of the package's `yam` command-line tool)
fingerprints a local file (`file4.mp3`) as well as downloads/fingerprints
audio from all videos on two YouTube users/channels
(`youtube.com/c/some_channel youtube.com/u/some_user`), excluding videos longer
than 600 seconds (`-L 300`), deletes any downloaded files after fingerprinting
(`-D`), and matches all fingerprints against those in the (PostgreSQL) database
with the database credentials `-U yam` (user `yam`), `-N yam`
(database name `yam`), and database password `yam` (`-P yam`).

**Command**:
```
yam youtube.com/c/some_channel youtube.com/u/some_user file4.mp3 \
  -L 600 -D -U yam -N yam -P yam
```

The output contains matches (if any) as well as information on each match,
including the `confidence` (number of matching fingerprints divided by total
number of input song fingerprints) and `relative_offset` (which part of the
matched song the input song corresponds to, in seconds); in other words, a
`relative_offset` of 300 means that the beginning of the input song corresponds
to the 300-second mark in the matched song from the database.

**Output**:

    "youtube_id": null,
  }
]
```

### Drop all tables in the database
```
yamdb -r -U yam -N yam -P yam
```

### Plot a song's audio fingerprint/spectrogram

The `yamfp` tool was used to create the spectrogram/fingerprint figures in the
background section above.

```
yamfp /path/to/file.mp3
```

### Download audio from all videos on multiple YouTube channels

The YouTube audio download functionality from the `yam` command also exists
as a standalone command-line tool: `yamdl` (this simply downloads videos as MP3
files without fingerprinting them or interacting with the database in any way).

The following command downloads the first 30 seconds of audio (`--end 30`) from
all videos on two channels
(`youtube.com/user/ytuser youtube.com/c/somechannel/videos`), excluding
videos shorter than 7 seconds (`-S 7`) or longer than 20 minutes (`-L 1200`),
saves them to a specified directory (`-d /path/to/dest_dir`), skips any files
that already exist in the destination directory (`-i`), waits 4 seconds for
YouTube pages to load in the browser after each page scroll (`-p 4`) to ensure
the page has time to load and the entire page source is obtained/scraped
(increasing this wait time can help on slower internet connections), and
retries failed downloads up to 10 times (`-r 10`) in case youtube-dl fails
to download videos, which occasionally happens.

**Command**:
```
yamdl youtube.com/user/ytuser youtube.com/c/somechannel/videos \
  --end 30 -S 7 -L 1200 -d /path/to/dest_dir -i -p 4 -r 10
```

All `yamdl` options can also be used with `yam`.


# <span id="usage">Usage</span>

This package contains four command line tools/commands. The main tool is
`yam` (**Y**ouTube **A**udio **M**atcher), which combines download,
fingerprinting, and database functionality. Each of these three components
also have their own command line interfaces: `yamdb` (**YAM** **D**ata**b**ase
tool), `yamdl` (**YAM** **D**own**l**oad tool), and `yamfp`
(**YAM** **F**inger**p**rint tool).
